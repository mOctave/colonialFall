Nations denoted by numbers:

The United Provinces of Central America collapsed around 1840. It is shown as collapsed here. Africa was still a total mess in 1840. I have divided up Africa slightly more and removed Barbary from the Ottoman Empire, but this is fairly close to guesswork as reliable sources are almost impossible to find. Some small islands may be the wrong colour, but I think things are mostly correct.
