1940 was marked by Germany and Japan's suddenly very large empires, and by the Soviet Union. By 1940 the world had been claimed and now most of what changed was a new division: a smaller China, a larger USSR, Japan, Germany, and pandemonium in Europe. This is the map that marks the end of the colonial era and the beginning of something new. In a few decades, Britain, France, and Portugal stood to lose all their possessions.
