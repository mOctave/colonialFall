The light brown areas in northwest Africa were in name controlled by the Ottoman Empire but really the empire had very little influence in that region. Egypt technically was part of the Ottoman Empire but was also somewhat independent by 1820. Most of South and Central America declared independence from Spain in 1821. New Zealand was sort of almost a British colony. Dutch Indonesia is estimated. Sweden was not a Russian colony, although it might look like it on this map. Vanuatu may have been British, but probably was not in 1820. Some islands might be the wrong colour on this map, accuracy is probably not perfect. Norway was in some ways a colony of Denmark and in some ways a part of it. It is shown as a colony here.
