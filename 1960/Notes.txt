By 1960 the great colonial empires of Britain and France had begun to collapse. Papua New Guinea has been show as a British colony although it was actually more under Australian control. The Soviet Union was still quite strong, although it no longer contained Poland, which left as soon as it could. Somalia united before 1960 and had high hopes before eventually going into decade after decade of civil war.
