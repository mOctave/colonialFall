Nations denoted by numbers:
1 - Prussia
2 - Switzerland
3 - Hungary (Austria-Hungary)
4 - Abyssinia (Modern-Day Ethiopia), a province of Ethipoia in 1820.
5 - Ethiopia
6 - Greece
7 - Yucatán

The Yucatán peninsula had rebelled just before 1860 and its being part of Mexico at that point was debatable. Texas had joined the United States by 1860, and Africa was STILL a total mess. I have divided up Africa slightly more, but, as on the 1840 map, this is fairly close to guesswork as reliable sources are almost impossible to find. Some small islands may be the wrong colour, but I think things are mostly correct.
